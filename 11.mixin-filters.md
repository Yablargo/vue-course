# 11. Mixin & Filters

These are usually used to format an output in your app.

## 11.1 Filter

A filter is a syntax to transform an output in your template.

Make a filter to transform text to uppercase and lowercase.

Chain the filters.

## 11.2 Filter vs. computed property

Filter is suboptimal in performance compared to computed property.

Even if you didn't change the `filterText` input, Vue needs to rerun the filter.

Vue knows what the computed property is depending on and only recalculates if the underlying data changes.

## 11.3 Mixin

One problem: If you have 2 components that uses this fruits data, we have duplicate code.

We can use mixin to refactor the code.

A mixin object can contain any component options. When a component uses a mixin, all options in the mixin will be “mixed” into the component's own options.
